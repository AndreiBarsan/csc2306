# UofT CSC2306F: High-Performance Scientific Computing Assignments

## Overview

These assignments consist mostly of MPI code implemented in C++, plus some Python used to analyze the experimental
results and create the plots.

## Getting Started

The code requires Open MPI and CMake to be installed, as well as a C++14-compatible compiler.
